# Introduction
In this project, I explored various neural network architectures for classifying medical images from the OrganAMNIST dataset. The journey began with simple Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), where I progressively introduced deeper layers and experimented with different activation functions to enhance performance. Building on this foundation, I transitioned to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are well-suited for image-based tasks. Lastly, I experimented with a pre-trained LeNet-5 model, leveraging its established architecture for further insights. Throughout the process, I incorporated diverse regularization techniques and tested various activation functions to optimize the models' performance and generalization.

# Dataset
The OrganAMNIST dataset comprises 28x28 grayscale images of organs, categorized into 11 classes, with a balanced distribution of images across the training, validation, and testing sets. In one experiment, I utilized a 128x128 version of the dataset to examine the impact of resolution on model performance. Prior to training, the images were normalized to ensure consistent scaling and facilitate faster convergence. For experiments involving MLPs, the images were flattened into vectors, while CNNs directly utilized the 2D image structure to leverage spatial information.
