# Introduction
In this project, we explored different neural network architectures to classify medical images from the OrganAMNIST dataset. We started with simple Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), gradually adding complexity with deeper layers and different activation functions. Then, we moved to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and finally experimented with a pre-trained LeNet5 model. Along the way, we studied the effects of regularization, normalization, and image resolution. Our findings highlight how network design choices directly impact accuracy and training time, shedding light on why certain models perform better in specific scenarios.
