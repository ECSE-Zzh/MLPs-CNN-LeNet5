# Introduction
In this project, I explored various neural network architectures for classifying medical images from the OrganAMNIST dataset. The journey began with simple Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), where I progressively introduced deeper layers and experimented with different activation functions to enhance performance. Building on this foundation, I transitioned to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are well-suited for image-based tasks. Lastly, I experimented with a pre-trained LeNet-5 model, leveraging its established architecture for further insights. Throughout the process, I incorporated diverse regularization techniques and tested various activation functions to optimize the models' performance and generalization.

# Dataset
The OrganAMNIST dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of organs, categorized into 11 classes. Each class has a balanced number of images for training, validation, and testing. In one experiment, I also used a 128x128 version of the dataset to study the impact of resolution. Before training, I normalized the images to ensure consistent scaling and faster convergence. For experiments with MLPs, I flattened the images into vectors, while CNNs used the 2D image structure directly.
